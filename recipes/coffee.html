    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>
      According to CraftCoffeeSpot, about 41 percent of Americans use a drip
      coffee maker, and about 27 percent own a single-cup system, with some
      overlap between the two camps. But, what about the java fans who don't own
      one, don't have access to power (say, on a camping trip), or prefer to
      make their coffee in a more classic way?
    </p>
    <p>
      Enter these four ways to make coffee without a coffee maker such as with a
      French press or a pour-over coffee maker. However, if you don't have one
      and prefer not to invest in new equipment, these ways to make coffee
      should be doable with the items you already have around the house.

    <!-- Steps of the recipe -->
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Start with six ounces of cold water per serving. Then, pour water into a
        small saucepan over medium-high heat.
      </li>
      <li>
        Add 1 tablespoon of coffee per serving to the pan. If desired, add sugar
        now.
      </li>
      <li>Bring the coffee mixture to a boil.</li>
      <li>Stir occasionally and allow it to boil for 2 minutes.</li>
      <li>
        Remove from heat, let it sit for 4 minutes, then pour the coffee slowly
        and carefully from the pan so the grounds stay in the pan â€” and out of
        your cup(s).
      </li>
      <li>Add sugar and/or cream, if desired.</li>
    </ol>
