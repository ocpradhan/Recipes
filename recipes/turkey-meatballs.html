    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>
      My mom developed this recipe after many attempts at gluten-free meatballs.
      We now have a delicious and healthy way to eat a food we love!
    </p>

    <!-- Ingredients for the recipe -->
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>3/4 pound ground turkey</li>
      <li>1/2 chicken sausage, casings removed</li>
      <li>1/2 cup gluten-free bread crumbs</li>
      <li>3 tablespoons chopped fresh basil</li>
      <li>3 tablespoons milk</li>
      <li>3 tablespoons minced garlic</li>
      <li>1/4 cup grated Parmesan cheese</li>
      <li>1 tablespoon kosher salt</li>
      <li>1/2 teaspoon ground black pepper</li>
      <li>1 egg, lightly beaten</li>
    </ul>

    <!-- Steps for the recipe -->
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Line a baking sheet with
        parchment paper.
      </li>
      <li>
        Combine ground turkey, chicken sausage, bread crumbs, basil, milk,
        garlic, Parmesan cheese, kosher salt, and black pepper in a bowl; mix
        gently with a fork. Drop mixture, about 1 1/4-inch diameter per
        meatball, onto the prepared baking sheet using a spoon.
      </li>
      <li>
        Bake in the preheated oven until cooked through and lightly browned,
        about 30 minutes. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center
        should read at least 165 degrees F (74 degrees C).
      </li>
    </ol>
